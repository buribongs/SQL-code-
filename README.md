# Project Goals

- Apply insights to one of Bellabeat’s products
- Make recommendations based on insights from the analysis.
# Limitations of Data
- Reliability: The data is not reliable. It has a sample size of 30 persons which is quite a small sample size to inform actionable decisions.   
- Originality: The data is not original. It was generated using Amazon mechanical Turk. 
- Comprehensive: The data makes no mention of demographics. This study is focused on products for women, and it would have been good to have a representation of that demographic in the data. 
- Current: The data is not current. It is from 2016 
- Cited: The data has not been cited.
