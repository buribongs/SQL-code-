# Ecommerce Data Analysis by Theodosia Ndefru 
## Dataset from Kaggle 
## Data Summary : 
The dataset presents e-commerce transaction records, detailing a high volume of sales over a period from early 2020 to late 2022. 
Each entry records specific information, including a unique order ID, the state where the transaction took place, the customer's name, the date of the order, and the status of the order (e.g., Order, Processing, Shipped, Delivered). Crucially, the data lists the item purchased, its category (like Motherboard, CPU, Graphic Card, RAM), the brand, the unit cost and price, the quantity ordered, and the total monetary value of the transaction before and after tax. Finally, each record indicates an associate's name linked to the sale.
